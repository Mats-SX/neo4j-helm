# Neo4j

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-helm.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-helm)

[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) is a highly scalable native graph database that
leverages data relationships as first-class entities, helping enterprises build
intelligent applications to meet todayâ€™s evolving data challenges.

This chart bootstraps a [Neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j/docker-neo4j)
deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the
[Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

This package is fairly similar to the Neo4j-maintained [GKE Marketplace](https://github.com/neo-technology/neo4j-google-k8s-marketplace) 
entry, which is also built on helm.  This package tries to avoid Kubernetes distribution-specific features to be general, while the other
is tailored specifically to GKE.

## Prerequisites

* Kubernetes 1.6+ with Beta APIs enabled
* Docker and kubectl installed locally
* Helm >= 3.1 installed
* PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure
* Requires the following variables
  You must add `acceptLicenseAgreement` in the values.yaml file and set it to `yes` or include `--set acceptLicenseAgreement=yes` in the command line of helm install to accept the license.
* This chart requires that you have a license for Neo4j Enterprise Edition.  Trial licenses 
[can be obtained here](https://neo4j.com/lp/enterprise-cloud/?utm_content=kubernetes)

## Quick Start

To install the chart with the release name `neo4j-helm`:

```bash
$ helm install neo4j-helm . --set acceptLicenseAgreement=yes --set neo4jPassword=mySecretPassword
```

You must explicitly accept the neo4j license agreement for the installation to be successful.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `neo4j-helm` deployment:

```bash
$ helm uninstall neo4j-helm
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and
deletes the release.  Be aware that it may orphan PVCs associated with the StatefulSet.

## User Guide

For a complete list of configuration options, and ways of installing, please see

- [External exposure of Neo4j clusters on Kubernetes](external-exposure/EXTERNAL-EXPOSURE.md) - how to use
tools like Neo4j Browser and cypher-shell from clients originating outside of Kubernetes
- [Neo4j Considerations in Orchestration Environments](https://medium.com/neo4j/neo4j-considerations-in-orchestration-environments-584db747dca5) which covers
how the smart-client routing protocol that Neo4j uses interacts with Kubernetes networking.  Make sure to read this if you are trying to expose the Neo4j database outside
of Kubernetes

## Versioning

The versioning of this helm chart will follow Neo4j versions for simplicity.

* Version 4.0.X.Y of the helm chart is compatible with Neo4j EE v4.0.*
* Version 4.1.X.Y of the helm chart is compatible with Neo4j EE v4.1.*
* (and so on)

The charts in this repository are for Neo4j 4.0 going forward.  There are previous available charts
for the Neo4j 3.5 series, but there are *substantial differences* between the two versions.  Careful
upgrade planning is advised before attempting to upgrade an existing chart.

Consult [the upgrade guide](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/upgrade/) and
expect that additional configuration of this chart will be necessary.

## Helm Testing

```
helm test neo4j-helm
```

## Local Expansion

```
helm template --name tester --set acceptLicenseAgreement=yes --set neo4jPassword=mySecretPassword . > expanded.yaml
```

## Local Testing

The following mini-script will provision a test cluster, monitor it for rollout, test it,
report test results, and teardown / destroy PVCs.

```
NAME=a
helm install $NAME . --set acceptLicenseAgreement=yes --set neo4jPassword=mySecretPassword && \
kubectl rollout status --namespace $NAMESPACE StatefulSet/$NAME-neo4j-core --watch && \
helm test $NAME
kubectl logs --tail=-1 -l "app.kubernetes.io/component=tester,app.kubernetes.io/instance=$NAME"
helm uninstall $NAME
for idx in 0 1 2 ; do
  kubectl delete pvc datadir-$NAME-neo4j-core-$idx ;
done
```
