To install the helm chart, you'll need a https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-helm/releases[copy of a release]; download a `.tgz` package of the `neo4j` chart; we'll use that release URL below.

== Standalone (Single Server)

```shell
helm install mygraph RELEASE_URL --set core.standalone=true --set acceptLicenseAgreement=yes --set neo4jPassword=mySecretPassword
```

== Causal Cluster (3 core, 0 Read Replica)

```shell
helm install mygraph RELEASE_URL --set acceptLicenseAgreement=yes --set neo4jPassword=mySecretPassword
```

== Uninstalling

```shell
helm uninstall mygraph
```
